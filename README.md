## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  Using Advanced regression concept ,need to build a model for Housing US based company

- What is the background of your project?
  A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
  The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
  Need to identify the most significant features in the house pricing.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
  Housing price dataset
